  				<ul>
            <li>Storytelling in songwriting appeals to people on a subconscious level. Everybody’s felt them, songs that feel like that have your heart in their palm, songs that move you to tears, songs that make you want to run, songs that make you smile… Music, to me, is the most fascinatingly resonant artistic outlet in today’s society. Its relevance is invincible.</li>

          <h6>Entry 218, 219.</h6>

  				<ul>
            <li>I went outside and I smelled night. I wasn’t trying to notice, but it came in through the breeze. I felt the rest of me come back, for a second. Summers as a kid, exams as a teenager, late walks home in my twenties. The traffic sounds now as it did from my bedroom window in grade six. Cooling barbeques compete for the attention of my inhale. The smell of carpenter’s glue beside unfinished porch projects attaches itself to opened bags of garden centre soil, expired sunscreen, empty beer cans and sweat. But not the gross kind; just the living kind.</li>
          </ul>

          <ul>
            <li>It occurred to me that it had been three days, since I last gave open air more than 30 seconds of my time. Which I justify with the knowledge that being out in public usually sets me back, as I am confronted with a community that can’t figure out who it wants to be. It’s an angsty teen. Volatile, unpredictable, yet justified. Apocalyptic in its interpretation of every move, full of well-intentioned (not always cool) rash judgments, and abrasively loud in its release of opinions, despite their origin of insecurity.</li>
          </ul>

          <ul>
            <li>It’s usually more than I can take, considering I am also, essentially, an angsty teen. I can’t go out and meet more of the energy I already carry. It feels gross. Indulgent, almost. A Sid and Nancy shit show of romanticized negativity.</li>
          </ul>

          <ul>
            <li>But outside? Ten steps from my cat? That, I can do. I forgot I could, but I remember now. It’s important to feel small, and I feel too big in my home. I feel only the time I’ve lived here. Only the problems I’ve had here. Only HERE specific successes, and their adjacent failures.</li>
          </ul>

          <ul>
            <li>But I’m a lot more than what my apartment makes space for. I am 27 years worth of human, and this apartment only knows the last 30 months. I take up more space within 1000 square feet than is healthy for my mind to accept as a percentage attributed to my thoughts’ influence. There is no competing noise. There are no competing barbeques. It’s just me. And David. Dinner. A cake and a cat.</li>
          </ul>

          <ul>
            <li>So I need to step outside. More. Even if it’s raining. Cause it’s important to feel small. It’s important to remember all the things that came before your current income, your current rent, your current neighbourhood and your current furniture. A curb will do. Anywhere that feels unchanged, even if everything’s changed. Cause the moment you start feeling big, your problems do too. Your insecurities take you to bed, as you pass the critic inside your head a giant megaphone. You don’t need to go out when there’s sun. You don’t need to go out when you think you should. You don’t need to go far, and you don’t need to go for long. But you do, certainly, need to go out.</li>
          </ul>
